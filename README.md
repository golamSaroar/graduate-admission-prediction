## Graduate Admission Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

The goal of this project is to train regression models to find the probability of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile. This model could practically be used in a web application to assist students in choosing the right university for them. 

The notebook mainly contains the following sections:  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (checking null values, dropiing unimportant columns, stastical summay of the dataset, etc)
- Data Visualization (histograms, pairplots, scatterplots, correlation matrices, etc)
- Creating Training and Testing Dataset (scaling, splitting, etc)
- Training and Evaluating Models (linear regression, artificial neural network, decision tree and random forest)

Please have a look at the notebook [here](graduate-admission-prediction.ipynb) or open it on [Colab]().
